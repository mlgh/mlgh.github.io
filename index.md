It's obvious that $\forall n > 0 \ \log(n + 1) < \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k} < 1 + \log(n)$ - quite easy to prove

It's also possible to write a set of equations

$$
\begin{cases}
x = 1 \\
y = 2 \\
z = x^2 + y^2
\end{cases}
$$

Standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques make a number of assumptions about the predictor variables, the response variables and their relationship. Numerous extensions have been developed that allow each of these assumptions to be relaxed (i.e. reduced to a weaker form), and in some cases eliminated entirely. Some methods are general enough that they can relax multiple assumptions at once, and in other cases this can be achieved by combining different extensions. Generally these extensions make the estimation procedure more complex and time-consuming, and may also require more data in order to produce an equally precise model.
